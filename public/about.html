<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My love of music precedes me. Throughout the course of my life, my love affair with music has developed like a storybook romance. What began as listening became obsessing which fueled practicing that facilitated playing that, at last, inspired unforgettable performances and experiences.</p>

<p>However, as I've matured and digested my life's experiences thus far, I've realized that a career in the arts is not sufficient in facilitating my meeting the constellation of goals and personal milestones that I've identified as necessary in leading a fulfilled life. </p>

<p>But, I still really, really love music. So, when people who know me as "that guy who plays guitar" (like I said, my love of music precedes me) ask, "Do you still do, uh, the music stuff?", I normally respond with a chuckle and relieve their concerns. Yes, I still do that music stuff.</p>

<p>But, as of right now, I think a really exciting application of "the music stuff" would be in a non-performing or non-representative role at a non-exclusively music-oriented organization. Say, Product at Spotify? I should probably learn how to code....</p>
